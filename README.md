### The Challenge

This is the third weekend challenge of the Makers Academy bootcamp. The challenge was to create a web app 
Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

### My Approach

I started out by using a TDD approach a very basic, not so user-friendly game that met the requirements in 
a very simple way. I had the vague thought that modulo could be used to decide the outcome of the game,
and after a quick google, came across [this article](https://therenegadecoder.com/code/rock-paper-scissors-using-modular-arithmetic/) and adapted the method for my code. After I had a 
playable game, I set about refactoring and making the user experience more enjoyable.
